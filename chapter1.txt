 1.     git init to create .git folder
 2.     ls -a to see folder content.
 3.     No chapter1.txt is in working directory(story). To put it in staging area(Files in this area are committed)
 use 'git status' and then 'git add chapter1'.
 4.     git commit -m " initial version-css changes"     -> -m is used to attach a msg to commit command in which what changes in code are done is told.
 5.     git log to see the committed versions

 6.     git restore --staged <filename> -> to restore the committed files into working directory from staging area


 7.     If any changes are made in file, e.g chapter2.txt externally but not committed in git.
        "git diff"  ->  used to see what changes have been made.

        Now, if we don't want the changes made or want to rollback to the committed changes only, then use:
        "git checkout chapter2.txt"

8.      Now for adding in external github repositories:
        1} git remote add origin <github link>
        2}  git push -u origin main
